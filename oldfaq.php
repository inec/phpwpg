            <h3 id="education">Driver's Education</h3>
			<h4>Did you know that in order to take Driver’s Ed in Manitoba, you have to become a client of Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) first? That means that nope, you can’t sign up your child on their behalf – he or she has to be present, no exceptions.   </h4>
			<h4>To become a client of MPI, we have to establish your identity in MPI’s database. To do that, we’ll need original documents that satisfy requirements proving your: 
			<ul>
			<li>	Birth date</li>
			<li>	Legal name</li>
			<li>	Signature</li>
				<li>	Photograph</li>
					<li>	Entitlement to be in Canada</li>


			</ul>
			
			</h4>
			
			<h4>You’ll also need two (2) documents that prove that you live in Manitoba and your physical address. To help you figure out which documents you can bring, check out this <a href="#">list</a>. The most common combination of documents that new customers bring in are: 
			<ul>
			<li>		Valid Canadian passport, Manitoba Health card, and bank statement</li>
			<li>		Canadian birth certificate, Manitoba Health card, and guarantor form</li>

			</ul>
			
			</h4>
			
			<h4>If you’re under 18 years old, you’ll also need a parent or guardian with you. When you come in to sign up for Driver’s Ed, you’ll also have your photo taken. </h4>
			<h4>Wondering where you can take the Driver’s Ed course? MPI has a handy course finder; use it <a href="#contact"> here</a>   </h4>

			<h3 id="test">Licensing Tests</h3>
			<h4>In order to get a driver’s license in Manitoba, you have to take a written test and a road test. Both can be taken through the school offering Driver’s Ed or an MPI Service Centre. </h4>
			<h4>Next-day appointments for the written test are usually available at our branch! </h4>
			<h4>If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact us  <a href="#contact"> here</a>. </h4>
